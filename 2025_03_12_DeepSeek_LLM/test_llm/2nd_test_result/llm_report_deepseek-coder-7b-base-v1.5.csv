If you click on a cell, you can move it.
If you click a circle, an edge is drawn from/to the cell closest to the clicked position. There is no restriction on the maximum number of edges.
If a closed path consisting of 2 cells or more is drawn, the value is stored as an edge (cells share the vertices).
If only 1 cell is drawn, the value of 0 is stored in the edge.
Cells and edges whose values ​​are stored in other cells as values ​​cannot be erased.
The edge direction is ignored when setting an edge.
Each cell and edge can have any value between 0 and 4. This is a model weight.
Each cell and edge can have any RGB value. This is a color.
Cell values and colors are displayed using bar charts.
Edge values are displayed using histogram charts.
Edge colors are displayed using bubble charts.
By clicking the ""Generate model"" button, generate the code (Python) that loads this graph as a Keras model and saves it to a file.
Use the Python ""pickle"" module for the file storage format.
Save a file of the data used to visualize the graph (list of edge list).

If the above list cannot be drawn as it is, you can modify it as you like, but you must clearly indicate the modification. 
The node of the output layer must be represented as [ -1 , , , , , ]. -1 must be set to the node No. position.

You should make a representation that clearly expresses as much information as possible as much as possible as possible, both functionally and geometrically.

The connection of the node to the node
At this time, if the connection to the node has been made already, it returns False without writing any information.
Note that node is a two-dimensional list in the format of [[n1], [n2], [n3], …… n1, n2, n3… are n values.

Return [node No., X position (px), Y position (px), shape (rectangle, round rectangle or circle), width (px), height (px), connection line shape (solid or dashed), list of node No. s of other nodes pointed to by the connection line] when there is a connection from the node, and return False when there is a connection.The query result is the same as (6).
