Each node in the ""node_list"" is another node object.

Create a function called ""draw_network"" that takes the ""input_data"", ""output_data"", and ""nodes"" as parameters and returns the result of the function.

Inside the draw_network function, create a new node for each input and output data point. Add the new node to the ""nodes"" list.

Then, iterate through the nodes in the ""nodes"" list. For each node, draw the shape and connection lines.

Finally, return the result of the function.

This model has a 2 input nodes, 4 and 6 nodes in each of the 2 hidden layers, and 1 node in the output layer. The input nodes are connected to each hidden layer node. Each hidden layer has 4 and 6 nodes respectively. The output layer has 1 node. The nodes are arranged in a rectangular grid, and each node is represented by a Python list in the format described above.

Note: The numbers in the list are node numbers, and the numbers in the brackets are the coordinates of the node in the form of (X position, Y position). The node number and coordinates are followed by the shape, width, height, and connection line parameters. The list is followed by the node color and the list of other nodes connected to the current node.",,,deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat,False
