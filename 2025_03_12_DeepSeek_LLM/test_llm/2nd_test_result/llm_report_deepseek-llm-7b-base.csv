It seems I have to check whether there is a shape and a connection line shape to match by converting them to a string first, but it seems that it is complicated to search for it by converting it to a string.
Is there any way to search for such a specific string?
Or is there any other way to extract node values in Python?
I'm sorry if it's hard to understand,
Thank you for your cooperation in advance.

A: You seem a little over thinking your problem. Node numbers are integers, X and Y positions are floats, you don't need to do any string conversion.

""Nexus"" can only refer to the nodes it can draw.
You must fill in each node No. on the graph with a word corresponding to the number.
It can't be written down if you have to change anything.
You must draw each node No. on the graph with a number (the number is an integer between 1 and 24) corresponding to its order No. in the list above.
You must draw lines to connect adjacent nodes with a short connection line and a long connection line.
The short connection line is a line segment of length 1.
However, you can ignore the short connection line between adjacent nodes (i.e., you can have a short connection line and not connect adjacent nodes).
The short connection line is a line segment of length 1.

When the list is created, draw it according to the list

A: I've tried to do exactly what you asked for:


*

*To draw a line between nodes, try to draw a line between [1,777,724,20,148,187,[3]] and [2,569,877,2,564,137,[1, 3, 6]]. There's not one point that satisfies both criteria (they have 1 and 2 as coordinates), but there is a line: [(569,877), (564,137)]. So, that's what I used as the line between the nodes.

*The ""X position range is 0-1000 and Y position range is 0-600"" is a big thing, and it's not very clear. Are you telling me that 600px of Y is the full height at that line? Or are you saying 1000px of X is from the left as the start of the line, and 600px is the end of the line in the top?

*There's no color in the list of information. I guess it's an RGB value. I added it in, and I didn't know how. So, if you want me to add color, you have to tell me what is good, and I'll add that to the list and draw it.


A: This is the same as a question I already posted:
Draw a line and a circle between two nodes
With some minor adjustments, the following code reproduces the result I got from my answer to that question. The answer has been slightly modified to work with list[s] instead of list[list[s]], as was requested by the question poster.
EDIT: In this post, I assumed the list of nodes was formatted as:
list = [

    [2, 569, 877, 2, 564, 137]

It seems this might not be consistent, since the last node in the above list is actually listed in the first one.
In a previous answer I assumed that each node had the following information.

[2]

*The x-position within the node:

The following image is an example of node 0 that is 0, x=76.061 and y=494.785 with a rectangle shape with a height of 20 and a width of 304.
Since the number of nodes in each layer has 2, it does not need to change if the number of nodes in the layer increases.
It is necessary to set a maximum value so that it does not exceed 400 nodes in either the inputs or outputs.
There is no maximum node value, but the maximum length of each list is 264.
At this time, if the input and output are the same, and if you want to draw it, you can set the input and exit nodes to (0, 0, 255, 255, 0).
If you want to set the node value at the same time as the example below, it is required to take care of the following 2 items.
1: The maximum value of a list of lists of lists is set.
2: The maximum number of outputs for a given layer.
If node values from the same layer with a given number of outputs are the same,
How to do it?
In this case, you can create a ""node_color"" dictionary, and set the color of each node as ""node_color"" (key, value (0, 255, 0)).
Since 76.063 and 494.785 need to be divided into the same list by 160, 76.063 will represent 4 numbers in the first list: [0,0,0,76], 494.785 will represent 8 numbers in the second list:[0, 0, 0, 76, 76, 76, 76, 494].

Because the input node number is 2, the connection line color must be different from the connection line color on the input node, and the background color must be different from the background color on the input node.
As soon as possible, the input node will not be drawn first.
In the future, the ""1"" node will be drawn in an unoccupied location, and the ""other"" nodes are drawn in the same location, and the ""other"" nodes are drawn in the same format.
The output node must be filled with the result of the deep learning model, the algorithm must be as high as possible, and the speed must be as fast as possible.
I have done a lot in python, but I am still very weak in the development of AI-related projects, or I have to do a lot of homework and experience accumulation before doing this project.
Therefore, I ask everyone for help with the AI learning system, and I will keep updating the original problem on the Internet. Any relevant problems and suggestions can be posted here.",,,deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-base,False

The above 51 nodes have each set the output list of other connected nodes to themselves, that is, no one out of the node has an output list.

So far, I think I have only made a basic progress.
I want to try the TensorFlow Python library, so I hope to gain your help again.

A: If you want to play around with TensorFlow you are better off creating a custom dataset. This will allow you to train/test your network using a custom dataset. 
One advantage of doing this is you have complete control of the dataset your network is being trained on. For example if you are creating a network to detect circles you can add in fake circles made of line segments to your dataset while in a standard dataset you may have to rely on the network detecting a circle made out of lines (which it may struggle to do). 
To use TensorFlow with your example, you first need to generate the dataset from the image you provide. Luckily for us TensorFlow has tools already in place to do that. First you need to use the tf.gfile.Glob function to find all the image files in your picture directory:
import os, tensorflow as tf
files = tf.gfile.Glob('picture/*.png')

Once you have found the image files you can use the tf.image.list_files_with_subdir to retrieve the image's filenames and image sizes:
def get_image_filename(file_name):
    return os.path.split(file_name)[1]

def get_img_dims(img_path):

    # Get the size of the image
    img = tf.gfile.GFile(img_path, 'r')
    img_data = img.read()
    img_dims = tf.train.string_input_producer([img_data])
    img_reader = tf.WholeFileReader()
    [_, img_height, img_width] = img_reader.read(img_dims)

    return img_height, img_width

Get_img_dims will return the img_height and img_width for each image. You can process the data using tf.split while the images are being read in. Finally create a new placeholder (you need to have a placeholder that has the same shape as the image data. As per the below example it will have the shape of [batch_size, channels, height, width]). Feed the image data into the placeholder using map_func, resize the data by passing it through a lambda function (here to make sure the image doesn't get lost to any scaling), and finally feed",,,deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-base,False
