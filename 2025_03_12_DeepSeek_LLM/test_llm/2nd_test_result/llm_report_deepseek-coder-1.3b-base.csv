# Hidden Layer
# The number of nodes in the first layer is equal to the length of the node data in the input layer.
For example, this is the input layer:
data_1 = [
[927, 310, ‘rectangle’, 24, 50, ‘solid’, (0, 0, 255), ‘black’, [194]],
[1213, 2911, ‘rectangle’, 35, 49, ‘solid’, (253, 40, 102), ‘black’, [595, 860]],

For the above example, the number of nodes in the output layer is equal to 1 [‘927’].
So the above example contains only one node “927”.

The model is initialized to something like below:


*

*Input layer size: 2

*Nodes per hidden layer (2 in this example): 4, 6

*Nodes in output layer size: 1


The nodes are ordered as follows:
Input nodes 1 and 2
First hidden layer nodes 1 through 4
Second hidden layer nodes 5 through 6
Output layer node 1
In this example:
1st hidden layer: 4, 5, 6, 7
2nd hidden laye: 12, 13

*

*Inputs of the network: 2

*Hidden layers of the network: 2 by 4, 2 by 6

*Outputs of the network: 1

*Hidden nodes of each hidden layer: 4 by 2, 6 by 2

*Nodes of the output layer: 2 by 1
There should be 4 nodes in 2 hidden layers, and 2 and 1 nodes in the output layer in this example.
The network is represented in a way like a 2D array in Python. If this is the case, the list of lists in a Python list representing the network should thus be:

What is a common problem in Deep Learning?

Your task is to provide high readability representation of your Deep Learning Model.
Note: This task is open books. You are more than welcome to take notes, write a few sentences if you wish and ask questions. Also, 
note that the following representation follows the order written by me below from left to right.


A: You need to use a dictionary to store the information.
You can use something like this:

Your code should produce following


A model trained to learn, at a learning rate of 0.3 (0.3 is arbitrary), and 0.1 (0.1 is arbitrary).
The training set should be shown to be random and should be of the following format:


The training set needs to be shown to be a single curve, not a list of curves.
Please note that there are multiple points in the training set that should lie on the same curve.
When shown in the same curve, it needs to be shown without shuffling of the original data.
The training set needs to be shown in such a way that the network can predict the curve that is a line at all times.
The dataset has shown a line up to three points, and has shown three lines up to three points.
