* inputs numeric values, data storage, and outputs figure and process them with PCA

in the following format.

At this time, each node is represented in the format of Python list ""[node No.,
X position (px), Y position (px), shape (rectangle, round rectangle or circle),
width (px), height (px), connection line shape (solid or dashed), background color,
connection line color, list of node No. s of other nodes pointed to by the connection line]"".

At this time, the color is represented in the format of tuple (R, G, B), between 0 and 255, and
X position range is 0-1000 and Y position range is 0-600.

It is important to draw a representation of high readability.","process that contains, 
* a PCA converts pandas dataframe into graph
* inputs graph, and outputs pytorch tensor and process them with process
* a feature engineering converts tensor into text
* a PCA converts string into tensor
* a processing converts tensor into chart
* feature engineering that, with chart as input, and matrices as output
* inputs numeric values, data storage, and outputs figure and process them with PCA
