4,False,,,,,Generation time exceeded,,"CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 32.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 12.00 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Of the allocated memory 11.40 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 9.53 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
