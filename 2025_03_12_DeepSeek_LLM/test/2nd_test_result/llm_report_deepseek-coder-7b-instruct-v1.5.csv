Your task is to create a deep learning model according to the specifications and save it as a json file.
The deep learning model should have two input nodes, 4 nodes in each of the two hidden layers, and 1 output node.
The nodes should be placed in such a way that the input nodes are in the top left corner of the drawing area, and the output node is in the bottom right corner of the drawing area.
The distance between successive layers from the input layer to the first hidden layer and the distance between the first and second hidden layers to the output layers should be the same.
The width and height of each node should be set so that the total number of nodes on the same layer is the same height and width. The number of nodes per layer is as follows: input layer 2 nodes, hidden layer 1 4 nodes, and hidden layer 2 6 nodes, output layer 1 node.
Each node in the input layer should connect to each node in the first hidden layer, and one node in the first hidden layer should connect to each node in the second hidden layer, and each node in the second hidden layer should connect to the output node.
All connections should be represented by solid lines.
The color of the nodes in the input and output layers should be (255, 0, 0), and the color of the nodes in the two hidden layers should be (0, 255, 0).
The connection lines should be colored (0, 0, 255). 
All nodes and connection lines should be as large as possible, without overlapping with each other.
Please also write a Python program to generate the deep learning model and save it as a json file.

Considerations:


*

*To make model information in the Python list clear, each model has a unique name in the model names list.

*The position of each node is decided dynamically according to the data of the model, which shows the location of each node to maximize the readability.

*If the model has multiple layers of the same number of nodes, the position offset of the same layer nodes is different.

*The colors are chosen randomly.

*To keep the nodes of the connection lines of the model clear in the representation, the connection line color is the same as the background color of the model.

To clarify a little more, we'll be looking for a way to visualize the models in such a way that for the different models, nodes are positioned differently and are also colored differently.
We need the solution in Python, using numpy and pandas if needed is fine as well.

The number of connections from a node in the layer l (l > 0) is equal to the number of nodes in the layer l-1, except for the input layer. The connection line starts from the output node and ends at the input node. The output node is always the last node in the output layer.

The values in the node list are generated dynamically and assigned randomly during initialization. Connections are assigned dynamically and randomly during initialization.

A neural network consists of layers, neurons, synapses, and weights. How can I represent the nodes in the neural network with a list on Python, where each node is described with a list with the following elements which are node number, position on x-coordinate (px), position on y-coordinate (px), shape (rectangle, round rectangle, or circle), width (px), height (px), connection line style (solid or dashed), background color, connection line color, and a list of nodes connected to it?
Surely Python lists can encode the connection but it may be unclear where layer boundaries are.
It could also be helpful to include information about the activation function and its derivative, but this information could be more specific to the mathematical formulation of your model rather than the architecture itself. 

Your list will need to be created and populated manually to match your specific network model and can be done as such:

model = [[node_no, x_pos, y_pos, shape, width, height, connection_line_style, background_color, connection_line_color, nodes_connected_to],...]

Here is a simple model setup for reference:
    
model = [[1, 100, 100, 'rectangle', 50, 30, 'solid', (255, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), [2]],
         [2, 200, 200, 'round rectangle', 60, 40, 'solid', (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 0), [1,3]],
         [3, 300, 300, 'circle', 40, 30, 'solid', (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 0), [2]],

It is important to draw a representation of high readability. The width and height of each node and connection line should be appropriate.
In the input nodes, there are 4 nodes and the color is blue. The color of other nodes and output nodes is red. The arrow direction to the connection line should point from the output to the input nodes.
The input nodes is [0, 500, 100, 'rectangle', 80, 60, 'solid', (0, 0, 255), 'black', []], 

The other hidden nodes and output nodes is [1, 600, 200, 'round rectangle', 100, 80, 'solid', (255, 0, 0), 'black', []].
The Python program has to contain the following functions:
1) Add_node() function: Add a new node to the existing model.
2) Delete_node() function: Delete a node from the existing model.
3) Change_node_attr() function: Change the attributes of an existing node.
4) Draw_model() function: Draw the model (output is png image file)

It is also important to have the following conditions:
- If a node is deleted, remove the connection line to that node from other nodes.
- If the connection line pointed to a deleted node, also delete it from the connection lines.
- Delete a node does not affect the sequence of the remaining nodes.
- If you change the node's attributes, update its related connection lines.
- If a new node's position is out of the boundary (1000, 600), it cannot be added.  
- If the node's color is not 'blue' for input nodes and 'red' for hidden or output nodes, it cannot be added.
- If you try to add a node whose node No. is already in the model, it cannot be added. The existing node No. sequence should remain the same.

An example of how the model should look like can be found in the last section of this text.

Finally, the output should be a Python script that includes both a sample model and different test of your code. For example, add a new node, delete a node, change the attribute of a node, and draw the model.

The deep learning model has 2 input nodes, 4 and 6 nodes in each of the 2 hidden layers, and 1 node in the output layer.
How should I continue with this?
You can expand your model to have 2 input nodes, 4 nodes in the first hidden layer, and 6 nodes in the second hidden layer. Finally, you have one output node. The model structure would look like this:

Therefore, as a representation of each node, use the default RGB color (R=0, G=0, B=0) for a node color.
The shape is a default rectangle shape.
Use a default size for the width and height (e.g. 100px, 50px).
To draw connection lines, use the default line color (R=50, G=50, B=50).
Use the default line shape (solid).
The input node is always located at X=100, Y=300.
The output node is always located at X=900, Y=300.
In the example, a 3-layer model is shown, but the number of layers is variable, and a model with more than 3 layers needs to be drawn.

Each of the above data lists represents a node.
According to the above data, draw a representation (preferably in matplotlib or pyplot format) of the deep learning model.
解决方案：
One way of representing a deep learning model visually is by using a graph. Each node in the deep learning model will be represented as a node in the graph. The edges between nodes will represent the connections between the nodes in the deep learning model.

Here is an example of how you can do it using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

# Given data
nodes = [[7, 4, 3, ""round rectangle"", 50, 30, ""solid"", (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), [5]],

At this time, the color is represented in the format of tuple (R, G, B), between 0 and 255, and 
X position range is 0-1000 and Y position range is 0-600.
It is important to draw a representation of high readability.
So, X position (px), Y position (px), width (px), and height (px) are all important for it to be a clear representation. 
For example, for the output layer we have:
Node No. for output is 1 and 
X position is 300px, 
Y position is 150px, 
shape is a rectangle, 
width is 50px, 
height is 30px, 
connection line shape is dashed, 
background color is (230, 255, 20) 
connection line color is (0, 0, 0), 
nodes pointed to by the connection line are [1, 2, 3, 4]
The model can be represented as: 
[
    [1, 300, 150, 'rectangle', 50, 30, 'dashed', (230, 255, 20), (0, 0, 0), [1, 2, 3, 4]],
    # More nodes in the model...
]
The representation of the model should clearly indicate the relationship between the nodes via connection lines.
The nodes need to be clearly visible and differentiated from each other.
The exact sizes and positions of each node, and the connection line between the nodes, are not important, as long as the representation clearly shows all the nodes and the relationships. Each node should be labelled with the node No. in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Also, do not forget to show the connection lines in both ways if a relationship is given in both directions.
The color scheme for the model should look visually appealing and make it easy to differentiate the input nodes, hidden layers and output nodes.
Since it's a deep model, it should have 4 hidden layers, and so there should be 3 lines of codes (layers) to represent it.
This is an illustrative example, in real-life, there can be any number of nodes in each layer. Also, the color palette and the exact positions will vary.
Here is what the representation of the model should resemble:
    [input nodes]
    |     o----o        o----o        o----o        o----o [output nodes]

Please indicate the following:
• Model 1: A deep learning model with 28,400 parameters
• Model 2: A deep learning model with 14,460 parameters
• Connection line color is blue.
The models are not necessarily required to be exact. Accuracy is more important. It is a graphical representation, so the numerical values are just an example, and the details can vary according to the model. 
The nodes are not necessarily required to be identical in size and shape. The overall structure (number of layers and the number of nodes in the layers) should be represented. It is also okay to have nodes with a different number of connection lines.

Below is a simplified representation of the deep learning model represented in a Python list. This representation does not include all detailed considerations you requested, especially the sizes and shapes of the nodes. However, it gives you the basic structure and connections of the layers. For a more accurate and detailed representation, you may need to refer to dedicated visualization libraries such as TensorFlow's TensorBoard or Keras tensorboard visualizer. 
```python
# Model 1:
model_1 = [
    # Input layer
    [0, 100, 200, 'rectangle', 50, 50, 'solid', (255,255,255), 'blue', []],
    [1, 200, 200, 'rectangle', 50, 50, 'solid', (255,255,255), 'blue', []],

It is important to draw a representation of high readability.
Node No. and node No. s in the node list are integers starting from 0, sequentially.
For the above, an example of input data is as follows.

[[0, 500, 300, 'rectangle', 100, 50, 'solid', (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0), [1]], [1, 300, 200, 'round rectangle', 100, 50, 'solid', (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0), []], [2, 100, 100, 'circle', 50, 50, 'dashed', (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0), [3]],

It is required to draw a representation of the deep learning model and save it as png image.

Note: this is a sample input data. You are expected to write a general code which can take the input data and generate the image of the model.

Also, please consider the following conditions when drawing the model:
1. When pointing to an input node via an arrow from the output node of the deep learning model, consider it as an activation flow.
2. Between each pair of neighboring nodes, draw one arrow (connection line) to represent the connection.
3. The connection line should extend from the center of the output node to the center of the input node.
4. The direction of the arrow is from the output node to the input node.
5. Consider the 'shape' in the input data for the shape of the node.
6. When 'solid' is specified in 'connection line shape', draw solid lines, and when 'dashed",,,deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-instruct-v1.5,False
