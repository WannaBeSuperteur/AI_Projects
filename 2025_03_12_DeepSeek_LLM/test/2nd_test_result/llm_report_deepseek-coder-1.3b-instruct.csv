It is important to draw a representation of high readability. 
And each value must be described by a meaningful sentence.
To do this task, we first need to find the X and Y positions of the nodes. Then, we can create a Python dictionary and store each node in it with their X and Y positions and other relevant attributes. Please note: the number in the connection line can be different. Make sure to adjust each part based on how your data is stored.

The model represents, in the order, the first node, the second node, and the third node. The number 1 corresponds to the 1st node, 2 to the 2nd, and 3 to the 3rd. 

In each node, the position of the node is specified as its X position and Y position, the shape of the node (e.g. circle, rectangle, or round rectangle), the size of the node (e.g. width, height), and the color of the node. 

Also, other nodes connected to the node through the connection line are listed; list of node numbers connecting to the connection line node. 

The model is a graph, so when we say ""connected"" in the problem, we're meant to connect 2 nodes together. 

The model is not fully understood at this time because of the lack of the complete model design, but it can evolve as more information and tools are available. Consider it as a start.
After the model has been defined, various functionalities like adding a node, deleting node, moving node/line etc., can be implemented using deep learning algorithms.
Implementing and testing of the model would be the next step.

Note: This model has been designed in a simple and intuitive way for demonstration purposes. A more interactive and user-friendly design might involve making the model draggable and allowing the user to interact with the model dynamically while still having control over the model layers.

It is important to draw a representation of high readability. The nodes are grouped into classes:
1) Input Nodes: Nodes at the start of the model training. They are given initial inputs in order for them to learn from it.
2) Hidden Layer Nodes: These nodes are connected into the hidden layer. Every time a connection needs to be made, this must also be done between hidden layer nodes for the necessary input for forward propagation.
3) Output Nodes: These nodes are given the final output of the model. They are only aware of their own input when outputting.
The model training process is done by feeding these nodes with necessary inputs, feeding the hidden layer nodes a suitable input for forward propagation and then providing these nodes with the necessary inputs for outputting.
This list of nodes is for a single neural network and does not contain any weights, biases, activation functions, or gradient descent methods. The nodes are not sorted in any specific order and do not have any sort of priority or weight. Each node contains no information about the previous or next nodes in the network, only the previous ones.

This task requires creating an abstract representation of the neural network which can be drawn, analyzed, and manipulated by different types of interpreters and visualizers. The output should be drawn in a way that can easily be understood how the neural network works while also allowing the user to modify the network structure and weights as needed.
 
Note: The task does not specify an ""optimal"" structure for the final neural network. Instead, it is given a set of constraints (input, hidden and output layer sizes, background color, etc). Therefore, a ""deeper"" neural network (more hidden layers) would be easier to use and understand.

Here is a Pythonic representation provided by the problem statement. The network is represented as a list of nodes. Each node is represented as a list with seven elements. The last element, list of nodes pointed to by the connection line, is a list of node numbers.

# In the following lines, 
# we define the node objects. 

class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, No, x, y, shape, w, h, connection_line_shape, back_color, conn_line_color, pointers):

```
In this example, `Node 1` and `Node 2` in the first hidden layer connect with each other via a straight line connection. `Node 3` and `Node 4` in the first hidden layer also connect to every node in the first hidden layer. `Node 5` and `Node 6` in the last hidden layer then connect to every node in the second hidden layer. Please note that these connections form a directed graph, starting from `Node 1` towards `Node 6`.

Each node is drawn with its properties: its position in the coordinate plane (X,Y), shape (rectangle, round rectangle or circle), width, height, its color (R,G,B), and whether it is hidden (with solid lines, dashed lines). Furthermore, each node is annotated with its number and the nodes connected to it via connection lines.

Please note that each node's number starts with 1, with Node 1 being the first node. The names of the nodes in this list may not be readable if the system is unable to display them because they exceed the character limit.

Please replace the values of the given model, and please provide the list of its nodes to the function for further processing and drawing.

Define a function for drawing the model where each line segment should represent a connection between 2 nodes in the model.

```python

def draw_model():
    # Your implementation here.
    pass
```

In this function, for each list in the input, hidden and output nodes, it would draw the nodes with given parameters. The function should represent this as a series of drawing commands. For example:

```python
draw_model()
```

This should draw the nodes first, then the hidden nodes, and finally the output nodes within the specified positions. The color, shape, size, and parameters of nodes should be preserved. If necessary, the function should allow modifying these for specific nodes.

Define another function for animating the model.

This list represents a simplified model of a neural network with two input nodes, two hidden layers with 4, 6 and 1 nodes in each, and one output node. The nodes and their properties are as specified, including their position, shape, the width and height, the connection line shape, the background color, the connection line color and a list of other nodes that this node is connected to. 

Implement a Python script that can parse the data presented above and transform it into a list of the network structures used by LibreCAD, which is a cross-platform Open Source CAD package that is written entirely in Python.

Here's a very simplified Python script that attempts to capture the nodes and their positions to be included in the final output model:

```python
model_nodes = []
for node_data in model_data:
    node_id, x_pos, y_pos, shape, width, height, line_shape, background, line_color, connections = node_data

    node_info = {
        'id': node_id,
        'position': {'x': x_pos, 'y': y_pos},
        'shape': shape,
        'dimensions': {'width': width, 'height': height},
        'line': {
            'shape': line_shape,
            'background_color': background,
            'color': line_color
        },
        'connections",,,deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct,False
