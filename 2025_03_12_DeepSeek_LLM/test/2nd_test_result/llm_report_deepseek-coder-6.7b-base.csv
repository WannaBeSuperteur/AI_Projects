1st-layer nodes position range is 50-250 and 2nd layer nodes position range is 300-550. It is to separate the nodes of different layers.
Note: a connection line between nodes is represented even if there is no such link. In this case, it should be shown at the back of the nodes, which is drawn after the layer of the receiving nodes.
Note: a solid line means a straight line, a dashed line means a 3-line. See below for details.
