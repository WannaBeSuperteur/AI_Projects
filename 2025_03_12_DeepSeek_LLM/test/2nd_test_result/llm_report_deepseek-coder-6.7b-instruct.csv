In this representation, the model begins with the input nodes on the left, moves across to the right, and ends at the output nodes on the right. 
Each node is depicted with a rectangle but can be represented differently depending on the design requirements or the visual style preferred by the architect. 
A line is drawn between each pair of nodes, and this line is solid or dashed depending on which nodes it connects.  
This Python list can be used by a function to draw the model by iterating through the list, utilizing data such as position and shape, and apply styles such as color and line style.

Now, I need to create a connection between nodes in the deep learning model using another Python list.
The Python list is in the format of ""[(Source Node No., Target Node No., connection line color, connection line width)]"".

Let's assume all elements (like line color, line width) to be same for simplicity.

In the network represented by above list, we are adding a connection between node 0 and node 3, 0 and node 4; between node 1 and node 4 and node 1 and node 5, and finally, between node 2, 3, 4 and 5 (in this order).

It is important to draw a representation of high readability.

The data is organized in such a way that the model can be read off this list and its positions are drawn accordingly.
The connection between nodes must be drawn on the representation of the deep learning model.

Here is how an example of an element of list looks like [1, 100, 50, 'rectangle', 200, 100, 'solid', (0, 0, 0), (255, 255, 255), [2, 3]].

For this assignment, we only have to consider deep learning models represented as described in this format where X and Y positions do not denote physical positions in pixels but rather are randomly generated with limits as above, shape denotes type of the node and colors denote their appearance.

The positions, shape and color of nodes do not matter as much in this context as the structure. The structure of the representation is a grid.

Since the number of nodes exceeds the number of unique colors available, we can consider 256 colors available to us. 

Write a Python script using Matplotlib or any other suitable libraries to visualize these inputs.

You can add one more layer, one more node input and one more node hidden.

NOTE: Please ensure that this script is easily and adaptably change the number of layers, nodes input, and nodes hidden.

Hint: Make sure to start from the drawing the nodes and connecting the nodes.

PLEASE NOTE: You can start with small numbers like only 2 hidden layers, and the nodes each can have only 4 or 6 nodes. Then increase as you progress.

PLEASE NOTE: Your final code should be generic to handle larger numbers.

I want to know if the problem still holds if we change the deep learning model to a new format?
Propose a new format in which each node can be associated with only one layer (it will be easier to visualize the model).
The list in this case should be organized in a way that you can quickly find a node by its number, and it will have more readability.

19,True,12864.63916015625,42.072731494903564,,"Represent below as a Python list.
A deep learning model with 2 input nodes, 4 and 6 nodes in each of the 2 hidden layers, and 1 node in the output layer in the following format.
At this time, each node is represented in the format of Python list ""[node No., X position (px), Y position (px), shape (rectangle, round rectangle or circle), width (px), height (px), connection line shape (solid or dashed),  background color, connection line color, list of node No. s of other nodes pointed to by the connection line]"".
At this time, the color is represented in the format of tuple (R, G, B), between 0 and 255, and 
X position range is 0-1000 and Y position range is 0-600.
It is important to draw a representation of high readability.
